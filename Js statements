JavaScript programs
A computer program is a list of “instruction” to be “executed” by a computer
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements
A js program is a list of programming statements

In HTML, js programs are executed by the web browser

Js statements
Js statements are composed of values, operators, expressions, keywords, adn comments
This statement tellls the browser to write “hello dolly” inside an hTML element with id = “demo” :

Document.getElementById(“demo”).innerHTML = “Hello Dolly”;
Most js programs contain many js statements
The statements are executed
Js programs (and js statements ) are often called js code

On the web, you might see examples without semicolons
Ending statements wiht semicolon is not required but highly recommended

Js white space
Js ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable
The following lines are eqqualitvent
Let person = “hGE” ;
LET PERSON = “hedge”;
A good practice to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / );

Let x = y + z;

Js line length and line breaks
For best readability programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters
If a js statement doesn’t fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:
Document.getElemetnById(“demo”).innerHTML =
“Holly Dolly ! ”;

Js code blocks
Js statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets { ... }
The purpose fo code blocks is to define statements to be executed together
One please you will find statetn grounded together in blocks, is in js functions:

<!DOTYPE html>
<HTML>
<body>
<h2> JavaScript statements </h2>
<button type = “button” onclick = “myFunction( )”> Click Me! </button>
<p id = “demo1”></p>
<p id = “demo2”></p>
<script>
Function myFunction ( ) {
Document.getElementById(“demo1”).innerHTML = “Hello Dolly ! “;
Document.getELementById(“demo2”.innerHTML = “How are you today ! “;
}
</scipt>
</body>
</html>

Var declares a variable
Let declares a block variable
Const declares a block constant
If marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition
Switch marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
For marks a block of statements to tBe executed in a loop
Function declares a function
Return exits a function
Try implements error handling to a block of statements

Js keywords are reserved words. Reserved words can’t be used as names for variables.
