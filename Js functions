A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task
A JavaScript function is executed when “something” invokes it (calls it)
Function myFunction (p1, p2) {
Returns p1 * p2; // the functions returns the product of p1 and p2
}

Function invocation
The code inside the function will execute when “something” invokes (calls) the function
When an event occurs ( when a user clicks a button )
when it is invoked ( called ) from javscript code
Automatically (self invoked )
You will learn more about function invocation larger in this tutorial
