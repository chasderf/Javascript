Js comments can be used to explain js code and to make it more readable
Js comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code
Single line comments
Single line comments starts with //
Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by js
This example uses a single line comment before each code line

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names
These unique names are called identifiers
Identifiers can be short names ( like x and y ) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume)

The general rules for constructing names for variables ( unique identifiers are )
Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ ( but we will not use it in this tutorial )

JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive
The Assignment operator
In JavaScript, the equal sign ( = ) is an “assignment” operator, not an “equal to “operator
This is different from algebra, the following doesn’t make sense in algebra
X = x + 5;
Note:
The “equal to” opeartor is written lIke == in js
Js data types::
Js variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like “John Doe”
In programming text values are called text strings
Js can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings
Strings can be written with double or single quotes, numbers are written without quotes
If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string

Declaring a js variable
Creating a variable in js is called declaring a varaibale
You declare a js variable with the var or the let keyword
Var carName;
Let carName;

After the declaration, the Variable has no value (technically it is undefined)
To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign

Let carName = “Volvo”;
<p id”demo”></p>
<script>
Let carName = “Volvo”;
Document.getElementById(“DEMO”).innerHTML = carName;

Note:
It’s a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script

One statement, many variables
You can declare many variables in on
Let person = “John Doe”, carName = “Volvo”, price = 200;
A declaration can span multiple lines when separated by commas for one let call

To let a variable be declared and yet undefined is to

Let carName;

Redecorating js variables
If your redecorating a js variable with var, it will not lose its value
Var carName = “Volvo”;
Var carName ;

NOTE:
You can’t redeclare a variable with let or const

Js arithmetic
Let x = 5 + 2 - 4
You can add strings and concatenation them together
Let x = “John” + “ “ + “DOE”;

Let x = “5” + 2 + 3;
// Output
523
Note::
If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and ocncateneated

Js dollar sign $
Since js treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names
Let $ = “Hello World”;
Let $myMoney = 5;
Professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in js library
In the js library jqueuery for instance, the main functions $ is used to select HTML elements
In jqueury $(“p”); means “select all p elemnts”

Professional pro-grammar
Js underscore (_)
Since js treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:
Let _lastName = “Johnson”;
Let _x = 2;
Let _100 = 5;
