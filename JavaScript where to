The <script> tag
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags
<script>
document.getElementById(“demo”).innnerHTML = “my First JavaScript”;
</script>

JavaScript functions and events
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code that can be executed when “called: for

JavaScript in <head> or <body>
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document
Scripts can be placed in the <body> or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both

JavaScript in <head>
In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head section

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
function myFunction( ) {
Document.getELementById(“demo”).innerHTML = “Paragraph changed.”; }
</script>
</head>
<body>
<h2> demo JavaScript in head </h2>
<p id = “demo”> A paragraph. </p>
<button type = “button” onclick = “myFunction( )”> Try IT</button>
</body>
</html>

So basically i make a button type and it clicks to my function ( ) and displays a different message
after the jump
You should set up myFunction ( ) in the <head> section of an HTML page

The function is invoked (called) when the button is clicked

JavaScript function in <body>
<p id = “demo”>A paragraph </p>
< button type = “button” onclick= “myFunction( )”> Try it </BUTTON>
<script>
Function myFunction ( ) {
Document.getEleemntById(“demo”).innerHTML = “paragraph changed.”; }
</script>
</body>
</html>

Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script
interpretation slows down the display

External JavaScript
Scripts can also be placed in external files
Function myFunction( ) {document.getElemntById(“demo”).innerHTML = “paragraph changed.”; }

External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.
JavaScript files have the file extention .js
To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag
<script src = “myScipt.js”></script>
You can place an external script reference in <head> or <Body> as you like
The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located
External scripts cannot contain <script> tags

External JavaScript advantages
Placing scripts in external files has some advantages

It separates HTML and code
It makes hTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
Catches JavaScript files can speed up page loads

To add several script files to one page - use several script tags:

<script src = “myscript1.js”></script>
<script src = “myscript2.js”></script>

External references
An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:
With a full URL (a full web address)
Wiht a file path (like /js/)
Without any path
File path with JavaScript is like
<script src = “/js/myScipt.js”></script>
