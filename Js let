The let keyword is a new edition within the js library
Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared
Variables defined with let have block scope

Cannot be redeclared

Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared
You cannot accidentally redeclare a variable
With let you cannot do this

Let x = “john Doe”;
Let x = 0 ;

So we have to utilize the OG “var::

Var x = “JOHN DOE” ;

Var x = 0;

Block scope::

Js had only global scope and function scope

The newer edition of js library introduced two important new js keywords:: let and const

These two keywords provide scope in js
Variables declared inside a { } block can’t be accessed from outside the block::

{
Let x = 2 ;
}

Variables declared with the var keyword can’t have block scope
Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block

So i have to have curly braces { } block to access a variable
{
Let x = 2;
}

Redlecaring Varaibles
Redaclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems
Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block::

Redleaclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem

So it reads {. var x = 5 } but not { let x = “hi” ; }

Redlecaring a variable inside a block wont redeclare the variable outside the block

Browser support
