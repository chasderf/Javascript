LetHow to create variables:
Var x;
Let y;

X = 5;
Y = 6;
Let z = x + y;

JavaScript values
The js syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values

FixedD values are called literals

Variable values are called variables

JavaScript literals
The two most important syntax rules for fixed values ar e

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals
2. Strings are text, written double or single quotes

JavaScript varaiables

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables

JavaScript operators

JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values

JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:

JavaScript keywords
JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed

The let keyword tells the browser to create variables:

The var keyword also tellls the browser to create variables

So initialize our variables with. ( var, let )

JavaScript comments

Not all JavaScript statements are executed.
Code after double stashes // or /* and */ Is treated as a comment

Code after

Javascscirpt identifierrs / names

Identifiers are js names

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions

the rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages

A JavaScript name must begin with:
• A letter A-Z or a-z
• A dollar sign ($)
• Or an underscore (_)

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores or dollar signs

NOTE:
Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names
This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers

JS is case sensitive
All JS identifiers are case sensitive for its functionality

LastName = “Doe” ;
Lastname = “Peterson” ;

JavaScript doesn’t interpret LET or let as the keyword let

Javascript and camel case
Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Hyphens

Hyphens are not allowed in js . They are reserved for subtractions

Underscore:
First_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city

Upper camel case (pascal case)
FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity

Lower Camel Case>
Javascript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter: firstName,
lastName, masterCard, interCity

JavaScript character set
Js uses Unicode character set
Unicode covers (almost) all of the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world
